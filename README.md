# **Solar Sunspot and Cycle Analysis**

#### Overview

This project explores the long-term trends in solar activity using the last three centuries of sunspot observations. The analysis focuses on identifying trends in sunspot counts, examining how the solar cycle length changed over time, and visualising both behaviours. The aim is to demonstrate practical skills in scientific data handling, time-series analysis, and clear visual communication using Python.
